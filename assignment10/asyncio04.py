#SuperMarket simulation
# • Supermarket simulation using Python asyncio to create a multi-customer, multi-cashier system.
# • There are three customers who purchase products:
# • Alice buys apples, bananas, and milk
# • Bob buys bread and cheese
# • Charlie buys eggs, juice, and butter
# • There are two cashiers who process customer orders:
# • Cashier-1: takes 1 second per item
# • Cashier-2: takes 2 seconds per item
# • Rules:
# • Each customer's order is a single task
# • Each cashier retrieves tasks from the queue one at a time
# • Cashiers can work in parallel, but each customer processes one customer at a time
# • The system must wait for all customers to be paid before closing the store
